# Movie Recommendation System

This project is a content-based Movie Recommendation System that uses **Cosine Similarity** and **CountVectorizer** techniques from scikit-learn. It suggests movies that are similar to a selected movie based on features like genre, keywords, cast, and director.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn (CountVectorizer, Cosine Similarity)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Description

In this project, we build a simple movie recommendation engine using the concept of **content-based filtering**.  
The system finds similarities between movies based on their content and recommends movies that are most similar to the movie selected by the user.
The main steps involved are:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   Combine important features of each movie into a single string. These features typically include genres, director, actors, and keywords.
2. **Feature Extraction**:  
   Apply **CountVectorizer** to convert the combined text data into a matrix of token counts.
3. **Similarity Calculation**:  
   Use **Cosine Similarity** to measure the similarity between movies based on their token count vectors.
4. **Recommendation**:  
   Given a movie title, find and suggest the top N most similar movies.
   
## Installation and Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git
   cd movie-recommendation-system
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
4. Run the notebook file `movie_recommendation_system.ipynb` to see the project working.
   
## How to Use

1. Load the movie dataset into the environment.
2. Combine selected features into a single text field for each movie.
3. Convert the text data into a vector using `CountVectorizer`.
4. Compute cosine similarity scores for all pairs of movies.
5. Input a movie title and retrieve a list of similar movies based on the cosine similarity scores.
Example:
- Input Movie: **Inception**
- Output Recommendations:
  - Interstellar
  - The Prestige
  - Memento
  - Shutter Island
  - The Dark Knight

## Project description and guide

## Features
- Recommends movies based on content similarity
- Fast and efficient performance
- Simple and easy to understand implementation
- Can be easily extended to improve recommendations
## Future Work
- Build a web application interface using **Streamlit** or **Flask**
- Use **TF-IDF Vectorizer** instead of CountVectorizer for better feature weighting
- Add collaborative filtering methods using user ratings
- Include additional features like movie summaries, reviews, and release year
